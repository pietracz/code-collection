git status to check for changes
git add . tracks all the files or you name the files instead of a .
git commit -m "commitment text" - it is neccessary to use commit with a message
git push -u origin 

For github it is also neccessary to generate and add a ssh key. 
First you need to use:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
With that command you see where the ssh key will be stored and you also can choose a name for the key.
Passphrases also can be added to secure the file even more.
When you have done those steps you need to get access to the key.pub file to copy its contents to your git hub page. cat C:\path\to\your\file.pub should work in bash and powerhsell consoles.

Afterwards you need to use the following commands as a admin otherwise you may receive an error:
Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual
Start-Service ssh-agent

Finally you need to add your private key to your ssh-agent:
ssh-add C:\path\to\your\file

git branch lists all branches of your repository
git checkout -b branch-name
git diff branch-name is used when you are in a specific branch. For example you are in your main branch and want to use diff, than you have to provide the name you want to check the difference with.
Best practice is to change some line in a branch and save the changes. Afterwards you want to checkout to your main branch and want to use git diff and git merge.
